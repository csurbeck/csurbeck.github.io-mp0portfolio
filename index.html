              <h4>Overview</h4>
              <p>
                The Game of Thrones Family Tree Generator is a website that I designed that accesses
                a public API to generate a random family tree of character from the renowned HBO
                series. The user can indicate specifics for the generation of their tree on the front
                page, such as the size of their family tree and their preferred gender for the main
                character.

            <h4>Objectives</h4>
            <p>
              The objective of this project was to implement fetch requests to a public API and
              subsequently handle the response from the request. This involved incorporating a
              status check function, converting the reponse to the appropriate type, integrating
              handler methods to express the API response in the desired fashion, and developing
              meaningful error handling.

              <h4>Process</h4>
              <p>
                For this project, I decided to take it in the direction of a family tree since I
                could use my knowledge of appending children to the DOM (Document Object Model) via
                the JavaScript as a way of build the family tree. The user's indication of a small
                or big family tree determined whether I was appending children to two or four
                different sections on the main DOM.
              </p>
              <p>
                I created two different arrays of numbers, one of numbers that matched female
                characters and another with numbers that matched male characters. Numbers were
                randomly selected from these arrays and passed in as GET request query parameters to
                return a JSON object of the character's information.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once the JSON object was returned, a character card HTML element was made that
                included the name and photo of the random male or female character using the
                information in the JSON object and then was appended to the appropriate section of
                the DOM (family tree level).
              </p>

            <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
            <p>
              From this project, I grasped the usage of .then/.catch chains for handling fetch
              requests to REST APIs. I also gained proficiency with integrating data from different
              parts of my code to generate fetch requests with specific query parameters as well as
              accessing and transforming data from the returned JSON object to create a nested HTML
              element to attach to the DOM.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moving forward, things I would do to improve this project that I didn't get a chance
              to implement would be eliminating redundancy of generated characters so that
              an individuals could only appear once on the family tree. In review, this project
              allowed me to extensively experiment with handling APIs  and fetch requests and
              further master my ability to generate HTML elements and manipulate the DOM.

              <h4>Overview</h4>
              <p>
                Gallery Curator was a website I created for my CSE 154 class to further master using
                JavaScript to manipulate class lists and the DOM. On this website, the user can
                browse and select art pieces from seven different art periods to create their own
                gallery. Once the gallery is generated, the user can experiment with different
                frames on the pieces in their gallery.

            <h4>Objectives</h4>
            <p>
              The objectives for this project were to implement functions that would instantiate
              DOM manipulation, respond to user events such as mouse or keybord events, and modify
              classLists of HTML elements. These objectives were achieved by using event listeners
              and writing JavaScript functions.
            </p>
          </article>
          <article id="process-gc" class="alternating">
            <h4>Process</h4>
            <p>
              I love art, especially pieces from the Impressionist Era, and decided that I wanted to
              experiment with and develop my DOM manipulation skills by sampling works from
              significant art movements that users could select to be moved to a specific section of
              the DOM to create personalized galleries. When developing the first part of the web
              page, I worked with flexboxes to structure all the piece of art the user could choose
              from. I also implemented a classList modifications to make a dark purple border appear
              around a piece of art when the user clicked on it to keep track of their selected
              pieces.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next, I implemented the DOM manipulation event that took the selected piece of art and
              moved them to the bottom section on the page upon the user clicking a button. In this
              project, the articles containing the images were moved from their former sections and
              appended to the gallery section, which caused the top part of the webpage to rearrange
              itself since the tiers were structured with flexboxes.
            </p>
            <p>
              After appending the articles containing the pieces of art to the gallery section, I
              created buttons that would modify the class lists of pieces of art in the gallery
              section to add one of three different frame styles. These buttons established the
              articles with class lists to be modified by selecting all articles in the gallery
              section, removing all other frame classes, and adding the button-specified class.

            </article>
            <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
            <p>
              From this project, I was able to implement class list modification in two separate
              ways: addition of a class to an HTML element as the result of a user event with that
              specific element, and modification of class lists on multiple elements based on a user
              event that occurred on a separate HTML element.
            </p>
            <p>
              I successfully implemented DOM modification, although the transfer of the image
              elements wasn't my exact desired outcome. Ideally, I would've liked to duplicate the
              HTML elements so that the pieces of art would populate at the bottom of the screen
              without changing the top part of the DOM. Nonetheless, I wrote multiple JavaScript
              functions for modifying class lists and manipulating the DOM.

          <p>
            Husky Guide is a mobile device app mock-up developed by me and two other classmates in
            our Introduction to User-Centered Design class. The app was an interactive map of
            campus that contained information about different dining locations and provided users
            with directions to those locations.
          </p>

          <h4>The Problem</h4>
          <p>
            This project was completed in Fall 2021, which was the University of Washington's
            first quarter with in-person classes following the COVID shutdown. Upon their return
            to campus, students were faced with many new safety and health regulations to minimize
            the spread of COVID. Many of these regulations revolved around eating and dining on
            campus, and the challenge as to where to go to buy and eat food on campus arose.
            Students also had different on-campus dining needs, such as access to microwaves to
            warm up food brought from home. Display and communication of dining and masking
            regulations in different places was both minimal and confusing, thus creating the need
            for a single source of information for University of Washington students.
          </p>
          <h4>The Goal</h4>
          <p>
            Our goal was to enable students to locate establishments and services on campus that
            fulfill their dining needs in a straightforward fashion. This included directions to
            desired location from the user's current location, and detailed information about
            regulations and menus from on-campus dining options.

            In the research stage, we conducted multiple steps to better understand the targeted

            user journey map.

            the Husky Guide project">
            <p>
              When creating storyboards, I created two versions: one with photos of a potential
              storyline that I developed and reenacted and another with illustrations.
              The information architecture outlined the four major functionalities of our app and
              offered visualization of the levels and variety of information stored within the
              different functionalities.
