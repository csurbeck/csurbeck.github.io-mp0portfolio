            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <div>
              <p>
                In the pivot I made while creating my final project, I decided to switch gears and
                focus on building a comprehensive web "piano" using the p5.js library. I really enjoyed
                working with this javascript library in the second mini project, and I also feel
                comfortable and familiar with the technology, which felt like a better starting place
                for my final project then trying to jump off the deep end with a new web tool that I
                was not nearly as familiar with. For the prototype, I made a bare-bones replica of
                the piano before I refine it. There is multiple aspect of user feedback as they interact
                with the keys.

            <h4>Project Scope</h4>
            <p>
              I definitely changed the scope of my project a lot from my proposal to this first
              prototype. In fact, I changed the entire premise of my project, but I realized that I
              I definitely theoretically bit off more than I could chew with my inital proposal.
              When I started to try and set up the Strava API, I realized that gathering the types
              of responses I wanted was going to be difficult since I only had a limited amount of times
              I could make requests, I had to make different access keys and tokens, could only access
              certain data, and was going to have a hard time transforming that data into a structure
              that could be read by the chart.js and turned into a graph. I made the decision to switch
              and make my project with with p5.js was founded in my familiarity with the library and
              my confidence that I could expand and achieve deeper complexity with the library.

          <h4>Development Process</h4>
          <div>
            <p>
              Firstly, I populated the screen with 9 rectangles and gave them curved edges to
              resemble piano keys. Then, I created an if-loop that corresponded to the creation of
              each key that determined whether the user was currently hovering over they key with
              their mouse. I had to use both the mouseX and the mouseY function to determine whether
              the cursor was accurately over the "key". If the condition resolved to true (the mouse
              was hovering over the key), then I changed it so that the fill was black instead of
              white and changed the dimensions of the rectangle to make it look as if it had been
              pushed downwards.
            </p>

                  Snapshot of the base keyboard before I implemented that code that made the fill
                  color change and the shape translate when the mouse was over it.

            </div>
            <h4>Time Management</h4>
            <p>
              In review, I think the amount of time I spent on the revised final project plan was
              much more reasonable than my initial plan. I invested around two hours trying to set
              up the Strava API without any tangible success, and the web aids to try and help users
              make sense of the different calls you could make to the API were confusing. For the
              amount of time I took trying to accomplish that task, the amount of progress I made was
              unreasonable. Once I changed my plan, the development of my prototype began to come
              along in a much more timely fashion.

            <h4>Issue Deep-Dive</h4>
            <div id="content">
              <div>
                <p>
                  The main issue I encountered was getting the key to change colors when hovered
                  above the way I wanted. At first, I approached the functionality by changing the
                  fill cover when the coordinates of the mouse were within a certain range. This made
                  it so if I hovered over one key, all of the keys would change to the fill color
                  that was supposed the indicate the key was being "pressed". This led me to the
                  realization that I would need to create a conditional if-loop for the creation of
                  each shape so that the coordinates of the mouse were checked upon the creation of
                  each individual piano key. This meant I had to implement a lot of if-loops but it
                  enabled the fill color to be set to the appropriate value for the creation of each
                  key. This also enabled me to implement the translation of the shape that occured
                  when the user hovered over it.

            <h4>Ideas for Future Development</h4>
            <p>
              Moving forward with the development of my keyboard,
              some ideas and features I would like to address in the future are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Adding more color and user feedback elements to the keyboard
              </li>
              <li>
                Adding scalar tones that correspond to the key as well as changing the feedback so
                that it sounds like a note rather than a constant drone
              </li>
              <li>
                I want to make another instrument, like perhaps a drum!
              </li>
            </ul>
          </article>
          <article>
            <h4>Implementation Plan</h4>
            <p>
              Since I have time to develop my piano from now to my final version, I plan on
              prioritizing the first two idea for implementation and then trying to make an
              additional instrument for the user to interact with.
