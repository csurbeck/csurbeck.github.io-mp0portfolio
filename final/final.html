            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <div>
              <p>
                For my final project, I made a rainbow piano using p5.js that utilizes multiple
                aspects of the javascript library to make an interactive digital musical instrument
                that emits certain notes according to the key that the user is hovering over. The
                keys change color and translate to depict that they are being "pressed" when the user
                hovers their cursor over the respective key.

          <h4>Development Process</h4>
          <div>
            <p>
              The first thing I did was find a way to generate the different RGB color codes for the
              color scheme vision I had in my head. I was able to add the different fill colors into
              the if-loops I created in the project's first development stage so that the fill color
              changed as the draw function cascaded down. I added a lighter shade of the color for
              when the key wasn't "pressed" and a darker color for when it was. Then, I started working
              to add the sound to the keys. Once again, I was able to use the if-loops for the separate
              keys, and I ended up using the if-loops to set the frequency of the oscillators to
              mimic scalar notes.

            <h4>Issue Deep-Dive</h4>
            <div id="content">
              <div>
                <p>
                  The main issue I encountered was getting the correct notes to play when I hovered
                  over the key. The way I initially learned to use the oscillator with the p5.js
                  library where it ran continuously while the code was being run, which presented
                  a bit of a problem because I wanted the notes to only be played when the cursor
                  was hovering over the key. I tried to integrate turning the oscillator off or setting
                  the frequency to 0 in the if-loops, but then the functions started to counteract
                  and the frequency was either set to 0 or turned off the whole time, producing no
                  sound. My solution to this issue was having frequency set to 0 when the cursors
                  coordinates were outside of where the keys where, so that the oscillator went quiet
                  when the cursor was hovering over keys, but then would produce sound when the
                  cursor was above the keys.

            <h4>Ideas for Future Development</h4>
            <p>
              Moving forward with the development of my keyboard,
              some ideas and features I would like to address in the future are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                I never got around to making a second instrument so that the user could switch back
                and forth between instruments in a music-making environment.
              </li>
              <li>
                Adding minor/major notes (like the black keys on actual pianos)
              </li>
            </ul>
