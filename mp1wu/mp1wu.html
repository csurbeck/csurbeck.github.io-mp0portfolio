            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>
              For the MP1 Browser Extension Project, I decided that I wanted to make an extension
              that was compatible with wikipedia pages that would populate ladybug icons at the end
              of every paragraph HTML element on the page that the user could then collect as they
              read the webpage. The brower extension pop-up would have a button that would deploy
              and append the ladybug icons to the paragraph elements. The broswer extension would
              also have a counter that would increment when the user clicked on a ladybug that they
              found on the page.

          <h4>Development Process</h4>
          <div>
            <p>
              The development process that I followed for this project started with generating the
              image that I would use as my icon that would be displayed in the extension library as
              well as on the top of my browser window. Although the production of this icon wasn't a
              required part of the project, it gave me an opportunity to experiment with making web-
              compatible icons with Adobe Illustrator. I made icons in 16x16 pixel and 128x128 pixel
              sizes. From there, I wrote the HTML and CSS files for my pop-up window, which helped
              me determine what the exact function of my extension would be given the functionalities
              that would be displayed in the pop-up window. Next, I wrote the pop-up JavaScript file,
              which signified my content-script to update the browser page when the 'deploy ladybugs'
              button was clicked. From there, I wrote my content-script file, where I used the query-
              select-all function to query all of the paragraph HTML elements on the page and then
              append the little ladybug images to the end. I also wrote a CSS file to go along with
              the content-script file to manage the size of the ladybug image. I also authored the
              script to remove the ladybug images when they were clicked upon and increment the
              ladybug count in the pop-up screen.

            <h4>CSS Transition</h4>
            <div>
              <p>
                The CSS transition that I implemented on this website causes elements to briefly
                enlarge when the user hovers over them with their cursor. The HTML elements with this
                feature on my website are my different project tiles on the home page as well as the
                email and LinkedIn icons in my footer. I chose to integrate the transition on these
                elements as visual feedback to the user as to which element their cursor is on, and if
                it matches the element they wish to interact with.

            <h4>Ideas for Future Development</h4>
            <p>
              Moving forward with the development of this web browsers, some ideas and features I
              would like to integrate in the future are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>A little environment for the ladybugs to "roam" once they've been collected</li>
              <li>To make this browser extension compatible with other web article formats</li>
            </ul>
