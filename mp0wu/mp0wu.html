            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>
              I began building my website portfolio over winter break upon my completetion
              of CSE154 in the fall quarter. It definitely felt like a daunting project to go about
              as a self-directed endeavor, but I knew it wasn't something that would make itself and
              it would be a great exercise and showcase of my web programming capabilites. For the
              development of this site, I started by creating the header so I could navigate between
              the pages I planned on building. From there, I developed my resume page where users
              could both view my resume as well as download it. Next, I moved on to the development
              of my 'About Me' page, where I contextualized my academic experience with coding and
              tech and gave some personal information. Then, I began to build out my project pages,
              which you can view from the front page of my website. In order to make this project
              complient with the MP0 assignment, I simply added Cheatsheet and Write-Up pages and
              added them to the navigation bar in the header. Additionally, I converted my interface
              from operating as a single HTML document in which different sections were displayed
              based of user events on screen by hiding and showing different sections to the
              employment of a main HTML page from which the user could navigate to different
              subpages.

          <h4>Issues</h4>
          <p>
            An issue that I encountered on this assignment was configuring subpage navigation and
            attaching css files to subpages. I learned that you didn't need to specify the folder
            of the css files for subpages since the subpage css file was at the same level of the
            HTML file that was referencing it. Unfortunately, an issue that I am still encountering
            and haven't yet resolved is how to navigate between subpages. My website is set up to
            successfully enable navigation from the home page to the different subpages, but when
            the user attempts to navigate from one subpage to another (eg. from the cheatsheet page
            to the 'about me' page), the browser displays a 404 File not Found error. I have a
            suspicion this has to do with the user trying to navigate from one subpage level to
            another without returning to the main home page level, but I am not sure how to resolve
            this yet.

            <h4>CSS Transition</h4>
            <div>
              <p>
                The CSS transition that I implemented on this website causes elements to briefly
                enlarge when the user hovers over them with their cursor. The HTML elements with this
                feature on my website are my different project tiles on the home page as well as the
                email and LinkedIn icons in my footer. I chose to integrate the transition on these
                elements as visual feedback to the user as to which element their cursor is on, and if
                it matches the element they wish to interact with.

            <h4>Ideas for Future Development</h4>
            <p>
              Moving forward with the development of this website, some ideas and features I would
              like to integrate in the future are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>More complicated CSS features</li>
              <li>Reorganize and design the display of my projects</li>
            </ul>
