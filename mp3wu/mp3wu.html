            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <div>
              <p>
                In MP2, I chose to experiment with D3.js and Chart.js to build a data visualization. My
                site displays bar chart visualization of two different subsets of a large dataset I
                chose to work with. Upon the window's initial load, the first data set displayed is
                compares the average income of museums by state, and the second dataset which can be
                displayed compares the number of museums in each state. The visualizations can be navigated
                between using the buttons at the top of the screen.

          <h4>Development Process</h4>
          <div>
            <p>
              Firstly, I assessed that I needed to find a dataset to work with. I reserached websites
              that had free datasets for use, and I found one about museums all around the US. From
              this, I downloaded the csv file and cleaned it up by removing columns of data that I
              deemed non-essential. After that, I created a new table in SQLite3, imported the data
              from the cleaned-up CSV file into the SQL table, and then ran a query to find the
              average income of museums in each state. After
              running the query, I saved the output table in a new CSV file that I stored in the
              data folder amongst my data visualization files.
            </p>
            <p>
              After obtaining and cleaning the data, I started working with d3.js and chart.js to
              create the charts. At first, I tried making the bar chart exclusively with d3.js, but
              I was grappling with how to configure the details such as the axis labels, so I
              decided to switch and use the chart.js library for making the tables. I felt that using
              that JavaScript library was much more comprehensive at creating the charts, and I felt
              application and format were more intuitive. Ultimately, I used the d3 .csv() function
              to parse the CSV data tables into JSON objects, and then I used chart.js to map the
              elements and apply them to the chart.
            </p>
            <p>
              After successfully producing the first chart, I decided I wanted to increase the complexity
              of my project by adding the second dataset and enabling the user to navigate between
              the two visualizations. I repeated the process of querying a subset of the data from
              the main museums dataset that represented the number of museums in each state. Parsing
              the data and creating the table was family similar to with the first data set, and
              then I added the buttons at the top of the screen and the JavaScript functionality
              that destroyed and re-rendered the data visualization every time the user clicked on
              a button to switch between datasets. I also added small details such as styling to the
              buttons and a label on the y-axis.

            <div id="content">
              <div>
                <p>
                  The main issue that I encountered and took me the most time to resolve was getting
                  the "ball" to bounce off the generated obstacle in my infinite loop sketch. My
                  first approach to this problem
                  was checking if the x position of the ball was equivalent to an x position on the
                  perimeter of the square, and if that was true, then check if the y position of the
                  ball was also equivalent to a y position on the square's perimeter. I was
                  essentially checking to if the point where the ball was matched a point on the
                  perimeter of the square so that I could change the direction the ball was "moving".
                  This was ultimately insufficient because I could determine if the point existed, but
                  I couldn't determine where the point was on the square so that I could change the
                  direction of the ball accordingly (i.e., change the x direction if the ball hit one
                  of the sides or change the y direction if the ball hit the top or bottom of the square).
                </p>
                <p>
                  My first attempt to resolve this issue was to try and determine if the ball was
                  bouncing off the top/bottom or side of the obstacle by looking at the value in the
                  array. I determined that if, for example, the x array contained values surrounding
                  the current X value, the ball was encountering either the top or the bottom, and I
                  would adjust the move variable accordingly. This still produced undesired behavior
                  due to the conditionals I was using, which would occasionally resolve as true in
                  cases that I wanted them to be false.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My final approach enabled me to solve my issues of determining the coordinates of the
                  perimeter of the object and also allowed me to evaluate which side of the obstacle
                  the ball was hitting so I could adjust the "movement" of the ball accordingly. This
                  approach was to instantiate four arrays, one for each side of the square obstacle,
                  and store all of the coordinates that made up that side in the respective array. Then,
                  in the draw function, I was able to evaluate the current XY coodinate of the ball
                  everytime the draw function was executed and see if the current coordinates existed
                  in one of the arrays. If it was located in one of them, I would either invert the
                  X or Y direction. I also made sure to account for the fact that the coordinates of
                  the ball were located in the center of the shape for evaluating the position with
                  a 10 pixel differential so that the ball would change direction when its perimeter
                  made contact with the obstacle.

            <h4>Ideas for Future Development</h4>
            <p>
              Moving forward with the development of my data visualizations with d3.js and Chart.js,
              some ideas and features I would like to address in the future are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Debugging the average income dataset. I believe there is something inaccurate about
                the average income of museums in Massachussetts because it is saying the average per
                museum is over $1 billion.
              </li>
              <li>
                I would've liked to figure out how to expand the y-axis to show all 50 states and add
                some more color and details to my graph.
              </li>
            </ul>
