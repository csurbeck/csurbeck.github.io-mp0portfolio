            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>
              In MP2, I experimented with many functionalities from the p5.js library to code a
              variety of sketches, each of which contained a different focus. These different
              focuses included:
              <ol>
                <li>coding a static sketch</li>
                <li>
                  coding a sketch that relied on a random variable to for populating the canvas
                  with shapes
                </li>
                <li>
                  coding a sketch in which the draw function looped infinitely, simulating the
                  motion of an object across the canvas
                </li>
                <li>coding a sketch which responded to some sort of user input</li>
                <li>coding a sketch that produced some audio</li>
                <li> coding a sketch that incorporated both audio and user input</li>
              </ol>

          <h4>Development Process</h4>
          <div>
            <p>
              I approached each different type of sketch we needed to complete as a different mini
              project. Before beginning to write the code for each of the six different types of
              sketches, I would watch the prescribed coding train videos. Even though the videos
              covered topics I was already pretty familiar with, it was very useful for me to see
              the coding train instructor use them in the p5.js environment so that I could gain
              more familiarity with how they functioned for making the sketches.
            </p>
            <p>
              I breezed through
              the static and random sketch generation stages pretty quickly, but then encountered
              more complexity with the infinite loop sketch. My idea was a riff off one of the
              example provided in the GitHub page of a ball moving around the canvas and bouncing off the
              "walls", or edges of the screen, but including a square that was randomly generated
              somewhere on the screen that the ball would also bounce off. The user input sketch, as
              well as the user input & audio sketch, were my favorites as to how you could use the
              mouseX function to make variables respond to user activity.
            </p>
            <p>
              After completing my sketches, I added the write-up to my MP dropdown button and
              created a sketch gallery that was accessible from my write-up page through the click
              of a button at the top of my page.

                  randomly populated squares appear to function like pixels.

            <h4>Issue Deep-Dive</h4>
            <div id="content">
              <div>
                <p>
                  The main issue that I encountered and took me the most time to resolve was getting
                  the "ball" to bounce off the generated obstacle in my infinite loop sketch. My
                  first approach to this problem
                  was checking if the x position of the ball was equivalent to an x position on the
                  perimeter of the square, and if that was true, then check if the y position of the
                  ball was also equivalent to a y position on the square's perimeter. I was
                  essentially checking to if the point where the ball was matched a point on the
                  perimeter of the square so that I could change the direction the ball was "moving".
                  This was ultimately insufficient because I could determine if the point existed, but
                  I couldn't determine where the point was on the square so that I could change the
                  direction of the ball accordingly (i.e., change the x direction if the ball hit one
                  of the sides or change the y direction if the ball hit the top or bottom of the square).
                </p>
                <p>
                  My first attempt to resolve this issue was to try and determine if the ball was
                  bouncing off the top/bottom or side of the obstacle by looking at the value in the
                  array. I determined that if, for example, the x array contained values surrounding
                  the current X value, the ball was encountering either the top or the bottom, and I
                  would adjust the move variable accordingly. This still produced undesired behavior
                  due to the conditionals I was using, which would occasionally resolve as true in
                  cases that I wanted them to be false.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My final approach enabled me to solve my issues of determining the coordinates of the
                  perimeter of the object and also allowed me to evaluate which side of the obstacle
                  the ball was hitting so I could adjust the "movement" of the ball accordingly. This
                  approach was to instantiate four arrays, one for each side of the square obstacle,
                  and store all of the coordinates that made up that side in the respective array. Then,
                  in the draw function, I was able to evaluate the current XY coodinate of the ball
                  everytime the draw function was executed and see if the current coordinates existed
                  in one of the arrays. If it was located in one of them, I would either invert the
                  X or Y direction. I also made sure to account for the fact that the coordinates of
                  the ball were located in the center of the shape for evaluating the position with
                  a 10 pixel differential so that the ball would change direction when its perimeter
                  made contact with the obstacle.

            <h4>Ideas for Future Development</h4>
            <p>
              Moving forward with the development of my sketches using p5.js, some ideas and features I
              would like to integrate in the future are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Increase complexity with my infinite loop sketch by generating more squares/"obstacles",
                but I anticipate that would involve storing data about the obstacles in a separate
                collection as to differentiate the edges when occasionally their randomly generated
                location would overlap
              </li>
              <li>
                I would've liked experimenting adding an audio file of my own and then using the
                p5.js library to generate some sort of correspnding visual display.
              </li>
